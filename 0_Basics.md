# ðŸ“š Programming Paradigms & Java Features

---

## 1. Types of Paradigms

A **programming paradigm** is a style or way of programming that provides principles to structure and write code.

### ðŸ”¹ Major Paradigms

1. **Procedural Programming Paradigm**
   - Focus on functions/procedures.
   - Data and functions are **separate**.
   - Example: C, Pascal.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm**
   - Focus on **objects** (data + methods).
   - Provides features like **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism**.
   - Example: Java, C++, Python.

3. **Functional Programming Paradigm**
   - Focus on **pure functions**.
   - Avoids changing state (immutable data).
   - Example: Haskell, Scala, Java (Streams, Lambda).

4. **Logical Programming Paradigm**
   - Based on **rules and facts**.
   - Example: Prolog.

5. **Scripting Paradigm**
   - Lightweight, often interpreted.
   - Example: JavaScript, Python.

## 2. OOP vs Procedural Programming

| Feature                  | Procedural Programming                 | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Focus**                | Functions/Procedures                   | Objects (data + methods)          |
| **Data Handling**         | Data is separate from functions        | Data + methods bundled in objects |
| **Security**              | Less secure (direct access to data)    | More secure (encapsulation)       |
| **Reusability**           | Functions reusable                     | Classes and objects reusable      |
| **Maintenance**           | Harder for large programs              | Easier with modular design        |
| **Examples**              | C, Pascal                              | Java, C++, Python                 |

âœ… **Summary**:  
- Procedural â†’ Function-driven  
- OOP â†’ Object-driven

## 3. Features of Java

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent** programming language.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

1. **Simple**
   - Easy to learn, similar to C++ but with fewer complexities.

2. **Object-Oriented**
   - Everything in Java is based on **objects and classes**.

3. **Platform Independent**
   - **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)** due to **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

4. **Secure**
   - No explicit pointers, built-in security features.

5. **Robust**
   - Strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection.

6. **Multithreaded**
   - Supports execution of multiple threads simultaneously.

7. **Portable**
   - Java programs can run on any device with JVM.

8. **Distributed**
   - Supports distributed computing via RMI and EJB.

9. **High Performance**
   - Uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** for faster execution.

10. **Dynamic**
    - Can dynamically load classes at runtime.

### âœ… Final Note
- **Paradigms** define styles of programming (Procedural, OOP, Functional, etc.).  
- **OOP vs Procedural** highlights differences in data handling and program structure.  
- **Java** is powerful because it combines OOP features with portability, security, and robustness.
